Project Overview :
    This project is focused on Implementing SLA Management for Hardware Group in ServiceNow, with the objective of improving the management of hardware-related incidents, specifically those categorised as Priority 4. The goal is to ensure that such incidents are addressed within 16 business hours, while also automating the pausing of SLA when incidents are put on hold and halting the SLA when the incident is resolved or closed.
    
The project leverages the ServiceNow IT Service Management (ITSM) platform, enabling us to automate the SLA lifecycle and ensure consistent service delivery aligned with business expectations. This initiative aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve incident response times, and ensure accountability in handling hardware-related issues.
    
Through this project, we aim to:
    Streamline SLA management processes for hardware incidents.
    Improve incident resolution times by enforcing timely response and resolution.
    Align SLA performance with the organisationâ€™s customer service expectations.
